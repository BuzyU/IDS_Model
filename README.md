## Introduction

DataRefiner is a web application designed to clean and refine data from various document formats. It processes uploads of Excel, Word, CSV, and text files, automatically corrects spelling errors, handles missing data, and delivers a clean, refined dataset ready for analysis or further use.

This documentation provides comprehensive details about how the application works, why specific implementation choices were made, and the limitations of the current version.

## Features

- **Multiple Document Format Support**: Accepts Excel (.xlsx, .xls), Word (.docx, .doc), CSV, and text files (.txt).
- **Spelling Correction**: Automatically identifies and corrects spelling errors in textual data.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Identifies rows with missing data and removes them from the dataset.
- **Data Export**: Allows downloading of the cleaned and refined data in the original format.
- **Processing Transparency**: Provides detailed statistics and visualizations of the changes made during processing.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple, intuitive web interface for file upload and results display.

## Architecture

DataRefiner is built using a Flask-based Python backend with a Bootstrap-powered frontend. The application follows a modular architecture:

- **Web Interface (Flask)**: Handles HTTP requests, file uploads, and results presentation.
- **Data Processor**: Core module that reads various file formats, processes the data, and applies cleaning operations.
- **Spelling Correction Engine**: Uses NLTK for linguistic analysis and dictionary-based correction.
- **File Format Handlers**: Specialized modules for reading and writing different document formats.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/datarefiner.git
   cd datarefiner
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install flask pandas nltk python-docx openpyxl
   ```

3. Download NLTK resources:
   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('words')
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5. Access the application at: `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

1. **Upload a Document**:
   - Click on the upload area or drag and drop a file into it.
   - Select a file in one of the supported formats (Excel, Word, CSV, or text).

2. **Process the Data**:
   - Click the "Process Data" button to start the cleaning process.
   - The application will analyze the document, detect spelling errors, and identify missing data.

3. **Review Results**:
   - View detailed statistics comparing the original and cleaned data.
   - See information about spelling corrections and removed rows.

4. **Download Cleaned Data**:
   - Click the "Download Cleaned Data" button to get the processed file.
   - The data will be downloaded in the same format as the original file.

## Code Explanation

### Data Processing Flow

The application's data processing flow consists of the following steps:

1. **File Upload**: User uploads a document through the web interface.
2. **File Reading**: The appropriate reader is selected based on the file extension.
3. **Data Extraction**: Data is extracted from the file and converted to a pandas DataFrame.
4. **Data Analysis**: The system analyzes the data to identify issues (spelling errors, missing values).
5. **Data Cleaning**: The system applies cleaning operations (spelling correction, row removal).
6. **Results Generation**: The system generates statistics and information about the changes made.
7. **File Export**: The cleaned data is exported in the original format.

### File Upload and Processing

The file upload functionality is implemented in `app.py` using Flask's request handling:

```python
@app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])
def upload_file():
    # File upload handling code
